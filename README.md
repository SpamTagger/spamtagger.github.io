# SpamTagger Website

This repository contains the source code for (spamtagger.github.io](https://spamtagger.github.io), mirrored at [spamtagger.org](https://spamtagger.org).

Note that most content which appears on the website is dynamically loaded by reading in various Markdown files from our public GitHub repositories, then converting them to HTML. This is done in an effort to only have to maintain a single set of documents.
